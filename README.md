# Webscraping exercises
Welcome to the the Webscraping notebook, where we explore various data science tasks using Python and popular libraries. This notebook provides hands-on exercises in API data collection, web scraping, and machine learning with decision trees. Each task reinforces fundamental concepts in data handling, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Tasks Overview:
### API Data Collection and Analysis
